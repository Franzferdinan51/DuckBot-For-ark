Permission enforcement tests — THE most critical tests in the project.

These tests verify that the permission system is INVIOLABLE:
  - Players NEVER see admin tools
  - Admins NEVER see superadmin tools
  - Unknown tiers get NOTHING
  - Tool call validation rejects unauthorized calls (defense in depth)
  - Parameter constraints are enforced
  - No amount of creative input can bypass enforcement
